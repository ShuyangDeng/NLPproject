85,"  I am very concerned about osteoporosis. My mother had that and arthritis. It is essential to enjoy life for the reason of staying healthy and alive. I am working part time which contributes to my mental health. You have to feed your mind as well and your body. .Being focused on a daily regime. Having high energy and adapting to changes in daily regime. Also having a synergy, being alert and aware of surroundings..I have attempted to eat more greens but its taking awhile to get used to. I m at a low with exercises so I am trying to do more to help with my osteoporosis. I do the T test once a year..to do more exercises to reduce osteoporosis, foods to help with immune system and IBS, and anything I can do to revive up my immune system.. ,  ....food diary:  Friday 2/9- 1 prune, 2tsp of pomegranate, yogurt, blueberry yogurt bar  Saturday: hard boiled egg, vegan chocolate pudding, brown rice, salmon, spinach, zucchini loaf  Sunday: (had the chills and was in bed most of the day) 1 prune, 2/3 cup of mixed spelt and cheerios, 1/4 cup fat free milk, 1 tst white organic raisins, chicken soup, 3 cracker, 1/2 cup quinoa mix, vegan chocolate pudding, 2-3 tbl vanilla yogurt, slice of zucchini bread .Patient has really done a good job at documenting her foods. she is interested in finding foods that will boost her immune system. She goes to the physical therapist for lower back pain and osteoporosis.    She is planning to go on vacation May 4-17th to Dubai so she is excited about that and looking forward to traveling.  ,  ....We talked about each goal even though our time was a bit limited. Patient got a referral from her doctor to see social work so that she could get referred to a low cost dentist to be cleared for her osteoporosis treatment.  .Patient was excited to update me on her appointment with the endocrinologist. Her heart rate was 78, BP: 117/72, weight 96-97lbs, O2 98. She also booked her vacation and will be traveling to Dubai Friday, May 4- Friday, May 11. She is still having trouble with her diet and would like to research foods that will help boost her immune system. Because of her varied work schedule her eating schedule isn t always the same. ,  ....Patient has had a rough week. She sprained her upper back at work so she took off Sun-Wed she did not go to work. She had a PT appt and he did a great job massaging her back, which she was grateful for. However, this week her physical therapist cancelled on her because he was sick.   She went to the Gouvenour dentist to see if she had an infection. She cannot have an infection in her teeth if she is planning on getting the osteoporosis treatment drug. The dentist stated he didnt think there was an infection, but that she need to go to the Bellevue Hospital dentist clinic to make sure. The BH dentist clinic has very limited hours that don t work well with her job hours so she is a bit stressed about that. She doesnt want the top of her teeth removed. She had partial dentures before and that didnt work out well so she wants to keep her teeth if she can. She is very concerned about her teeth and the side effects of Prolia. .1. Patient has a lot to do before her trip to Dubai. She wants to get everything done in preparation for the osteoporosis treatment drug out of the way like getting her teeth checked. She also wants to make sure she is in top shape so she doesn t get sick while she is away and traveling. through all of this she stated that she is able to maintain eating some type of green vegetables every  single day, but hadn t been the norm.  2. Ask her if there are any updates on the BH dentist clinic  3. Patient felt comfortable to express her concerns. She is staying on top of everything that she needs to get done.  4. Ask patient how she is managing stress. She is very worried and concerned about the osteoporosis drug and possibly losing a good portion of her teeth. ,  ....Patient gave me a full update on all her appointments and things that she needs to get done before her vacation. Her next PCP appointment is 5/2 at 5pm. He also has a dentist appointment at BH that same day to see if she has an infection. .Overall the patient is doing well. She still wants to improve her immune system, however she is sensitive to many foods that generally would help. She has a lot going on in terms of her health she is met with a skin doctor to see if there is anything they can do about her alopecia. The alopecia specialist stated that they needed to do another biopsy and would need to the original diagnosis. There is a chance that the drug DPCP will help still up hair follicles if she doesn t have too much scar tissue. She needs to contact the original doctor which luckily is still practicing at a private clinic on the UWS. Her physical therapist mentioned that she should gain 5-10lbs. He referred her to a RD to guide her on her diet. PT said that if she gained some weight it would help with her bone strength. Patient said that she would call the RD and make an appointment. She is going to try and eat larger portions and maybe eat some more protein to help her gain weight until then. She is still having some slight pain. She noted that it was different from day to day depending on her work day.  ,  ....The patient is going to dubai on Friday for 10 days. She is excited about her trip. She still has a lot to do before she goes. .Patient has a lot going on. She is still worried about the osteoporosis drug Prolia and the side effects. She needs to to go to the dentist to see if there is an infection in her teeth. She has to get a biopsy on her head for her potential alopecia treatment. She also has another trip planned to Paris 6/30-7/11. Her physical therapist recommended that she gain 5-10lbs in order to help her spine. She has GI problems so she isn t sure what she can eat. We talked about healthy sources of protein to help her gain weight. She will talk to Dr. Lerner about this to see what he suggests and if he thinks weight gain would be a good idea.  Her next PCP appt in May 2nd at 5pm. ,  ....Patient returned back from vacation to Dubai. She was able to maintain her eating habits while on vacation. .Patient just returned back from vacation from Dubai. She stated she thought 10 days in Dubai was too much. She had many delayed flights and there were dust storms. She ate a lot of food from supermarkets so that she could control what she was eating. Her back was fine during the trip though her shoulder was starting to hurt her a bit, likely due to her luggage. She had a PCP appt with Dr. Lerner on 5/2 and he suggested that she gain 5lbs. He suggested that she use the protein smoothie shake nutrament to help her.  She has an appointment 6/4 at 1:30pm to do a bioposy for her alopecia. It will require stitches for 2 weeks then they will come out.   Next encounter will follow up on: nutrament, dentist appointment/osteoporosis drug, and alopecia appt ,  ....We spoke about her osteoporosis- Prolia dilemma and about her weight. We did not go into detail about her eating habits.   She leaves for her vacation to Paris on 6/30 and will come back on 7/11..Patient has a lot going on in the next few weeks. She is managing all of her medical appointments so that she can prepare for her upcoming vacation. She has had to reschedule her alopecia biopsy many times and finally got it reschedule for 6/18, but now she has been scheduled to work so she s going to have to reschedule again. She also hasn t schedule her Prolia appointment yet. She isn t sure if she wants to get it done before or after her trip to Paris. She doesn t have physical therapy scheduled this week, but she is hoping to have an appointment with him next week. Her weight is stable. She hasn t been gaining any weight, but she also hasn t been losing any. She wasn t able to find the Nutrament shake Dr. Lerner suggested. I saw it at CVS and recommended she check there. She had her biannual skin scan. her skin is thinning so the dermatologist prescribed her a cram that she will use. She can no longer use the pharmacy at Bh so she goes to her local duane reade. ,  ....Patient has a lot to do before and after her trip. She is still thinking about the Prolia even though she has an appointment scheduled for 7/17. She is still worried and stressed about her apartment situation. on the 13th her landlord sent out letters saying that he wants the tenants to move out so that he can sell the building.  .PAtient is preparing for a trip to Paris. She has to schedule her prolia appointment, her alopecia biopsy and physical therapy. She  also needs to check in on her food stamps renewal. It happens every 2 years. The deadline is 7/31. She stated her physical therapy overall has been going well. She hasnt had severe back pain in a few weeks so she is doing much better. In order to cope with her stress she sees a therapist named  name xx  who she sees 2x/ week for talk therapy.   Upcoming appointments:   7/17- Prolia shot @BH 9am  7/23: Alopecia biopsy @NYU 1:30pm ,  ....Patient is back from her vacation in Paris. she is doing well. We talked mostly about her Prolia shot that she received today. We talked a little bit about her diet, but didnt get into a lot of detail since she was out on vacation the past 2 weeks..Patient is doing well. She just came back from her vacation in Paris. She stated it was an exciting trip and she really loved her hotel. She went to London for 1 day, but there were major train delays so she didn t get to spend as much time there as she would have hoped but the weather was beautiful nonetheless. However, due to her eating so many croissants she was constipated from Sun-Wed so she went to urgent care where they.  On Friday she has a scalp biopsy to find out if she has the scarring kind of alopecia or the non scarring kind. She will get her results in 2 weeks. The doc stated that she thinks its severe scarring and shes not confident there will be anything that they can do. This lowered the spirit of the patient a little bit but nonetheless she will do the biopsy to make sure.   She did the Prolia shot today! She has to take tums 2x/ day for a few days. Stated the injection was quick. She has to pay $249 out of pocket for the shot. She will have to do a bone densiity test in 5-6 months to see if it had any affect on her.   PAtient reported that she needs a new PT script from Dr. Lerner for he right shoulder/ upper arm area. CHW will email Dr. Lerner to request script. She got dizzy on the treadmill.    her Food stamps have been reduced from $189/ month to $15/ month. She has been on it for 4 years. Her benefits expire on 7/31. She sent in an application in early June but apparently they didnt get it. So she went to the harlem office to do a appllication fair hearing to hopefully get more food stamp allowance for the month.  ,  ....Patient confirmed that she received the new PT script from Dr. Lerner so that she could continue her PT exercises for her arm. Since her Prolia shot she has been having muscle spasms in her arm. She is hoping the PT will help alleviate that. .Patient has a lot to do lately. She stated that her food stamps hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. She is hoping to get her amount increased. She hadn t heard back from the lawyers yet, so she is thinking that it is unlikely that she will get the $138/month that she was getting before, but she is hoping for the best. She spoke with a Bank of America financial advisor who told her that with her budgeting/ finances she will have about $30 extra each day. So that made her feel much better.   She also talked about how she is unsure if her Barnes and Noble (where she works) will close at the end of the year. She heard that they are $2 million in debt. If the store did close she is unsure if there is a chance to transfer to a different barnes and noble store.   In regards to her apartment. She looked at some in her area, but nothing was suitable for her. She plans to stay in her apartment despite the owners desire to buy out the residents and sell the apt.  ,  ....Patient is still experiencing muscle inflammation from the Prolia shot she received 4 weeks ago in July. She is very frustrated because it is affecting some of her everyday movements. For her food stamps it was never resolved. She called the casework twice and never heard back from her. So she will only be getting $15 worth of foodstamps each month which might limit her healthy eat choices. .1. Patient is very good about advocating for herself.   2. For the next encounter I want to make sure to ask her about if her physical therapy is helping her arm at all. I also want to check in about her back to see if things are getting better. She still has not received an appointment from Dr. Lerner. I will check in with him to see if he is able to fit her into her schedule.   3. Patient is very good about attending her appointments.   4. Patient is excited about her trip to Los Angeles, though she is in a little discomfort with her arm she his going to make the best out of her trip. She is also worried about the fate of her job. She heard a rumor that they may be going out of business so she is not sure what will happen if it does.   "

She stated she had a weird experience there where she had a sonogram and the nurse couldn t find her gallbladder though it has never been removed.
